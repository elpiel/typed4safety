### Abstract

> In this talk we will explore the advantage of Generics together and see if it could save future space missions. Generics are also used in the Typestate pattern but let's see how far we can get with it, its advantages and alsoâ€¦ disadvantages. We can apply the Rust type system to safety- and mission-critical systems and avoid losing a probe in space (NASA Mars climate orbiter, 1999)

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:** Using the type system can ensure that our 

**Cons:** As you will see from the types generated for the typed builder or the units of measurement crate, they are quite intimidating at first and you will need some time to get used to them.
